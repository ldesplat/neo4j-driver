Simple javascript neo4j driver

## Work in Progress

You are much better off using approved neo4j javascript drivers. This is currently a very bad driver with poor code. It is being built out of the needs of having a simpler driver that does not over manipulate the results. API experiements will be frequent so code will break and there is no documentation!

Be warned, there are many issues.
